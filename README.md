This program is an adaptation of a simple web browser. This web
browser contains features like interactive responses for valid URLs, going forward and 
backward in a linear history chain, and branched history. 

The branched history works when you let's say start on nba.com and press on the tickets tab. Then,
you go back to nba.com and press on the teams tab. There, you will have the ability to immediately
go to the tickets branch from the teams branch vice versa.
